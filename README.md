[ARC-AGI-2 reference](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi/2/).

I built a Python solver with Claude ü§ñ over the weekend to test an idea I had‚Äîcould treating ARC-AGI-2 puzzles as visual pattern recognition tasks rather than symbolic manipulation problems actually work? The arc_visual_solver employs a phased visual approach by converting numerical grids into PNG images and leveraging GPT-5's multimodal capabilities. The solver progressively feeds training examples through distinct phases: first showing an input-output pair as color-coded images using a fixed palette mapping 0-9 to specific colors, then presenting subsequent training inputs and asking the model to predict outputs before revealing the actual answers. Throughout this process, the solver maintains conversation history and emphasizes key principles in its prompts‚Äîthat transformations are deterministic and reproducible, that symbols may have semantic significance through their visual properties, and that compositional reasoning with turn-by-turn rule application may be necessary.

The technical implementation uses GPT-5-thinking model, configured with high reasoning effort and function calling capabilities. The solver provides a visualization tool that the model can invoke to generate intermediate grid representations during its reasoning process, allowing for iterative refinement of hypotheses. In successful runs, GPT-5 utilized the tool more than usual, getting a visual representation of a few different approaches. This approach aligns with Fran√ßois Chollet's emphasis on the importance of visual reasoning and compositional generalization‚Äîrather than relying purely on pattern memorization, the visual format may help the model identify transformation rules that are more apparent through visual inspection than numerical analysis, potentially engaging different reasoning pathways that are less dependent on training data contamination.

I achieved a 22% score on ARC-AGI-2's evaluation dataset in initial testing of 40 sample problems, which needs more investigation but represents a significant improvement over the current AI state-of-the-art of 15.9%. Each problem cost roughly $0.90 in tokens to solve. The visual approach may be tapping into the importance of perceptual grounding in abstract reasoning‚Äîby presenting puzzles as images rather than symbolic representations, the model might be engaging different cognitive pathways that are less dependent on memorized patterns and more focused on genuine visual pattern recognition. The fact that extensive exploration is needed suggests the model is doing sophisticated pattern matching, but the visual format may help distinguish between superficial statistical correlations and meaningful geometric transformations. Testing on guaranteed unseen data is needed for legitimate validation. Even if the 22% score still reflects some degree of training data influence (or more likely isn't born out in further testing to such a degree), the methodology demonstrates that visual reasoning approaches can substantially improve AI performance on abstract reasoning tasks‚Äînotably, naive prompting without visuals failed on problems where the visual solver succeeded, suggesting the visual format itself may be key to accessing latent reasoning capabilities.

The detailed analysis of GPT-5's problem-solving patterns reveals genuinely sophisticated behavior that goes beyond simple pattern matching. The model demonstrates systematic hypothesis formation, developing explicit testable rules after examining each training example, and shows progressive refinement when predictions fail‚Äîgenuinely revising its understanding rather than making superficial adjustments. Perhaps most remarkably, GPT-5 actively uses the visualization tool to test hypotheses, showing exploratory behavior, and frequently assigns meaningful semantic labels to patterns like "onion layers," "rooms and corridors," or "anchor points," suggesting it's building abstract representations rather than just processing pixels. The model consistently acknowledges ambiguity explicitly, emphasizes finding rules that work across ALL examples (showing understanding of determinism requirements), and demonstrates self-correction capabilities by identifying specific aspects of failed rules rather than starting over.

Success patterns emerge from breaking problems into sub-components, invariant detection, and multi-level pattern recognition, while failures typically involve over-specification, ambiguous ordering rules, and edge case handling. The visual approach appears to activate different reasoning pathways through Gestalt principles, direct spatial reasoning engagement, and immediate pattern salience that makes visual patterns like hollow squares or connected regions apparent without requiring coordinate arithmetic. While the 22% success rate (on limited testing) shows both potential and limitations, the systematic exploration and genuine problem-solving behavior observed suggests that visual presentation may indeed unlock spatial reasoning capabilities that purely symbolic approaches fundamentally miss.


### Setup and running

1. Clone repo
2. `export OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
3. `python3 arc_visual_solver.py ARC-AGI-2/data/training/00576224.json`
4. Or `python3 run_batch.py 10 -e -v -p 5` (runs 10 random problems from the evaluation set across 5 workers using the visual solver)
4. Use help menu to see other options (what dataset to run, run in parallel, etc.)
5. There are a few little helper python scripts for visualization

### Examples

Example: when comparing failed problems to GPT-5 prompting without visuals it becomes clear that the visual solver got much further than a naive implementation would have

Example: textual reasoning shows (in addition to the images above) that the visual solver is immediately able to identify core rules, while text/data-only inputs yield little understanding.

<summary>Visual Solver reasoning (e3721c99)</summary>

What matters
- The blue bar/frame divides a small ‚Äúpalette‚Äù area from the main board.
- In the palette, each colored swatch contains a number of black squares. That number encodes a hole-count. The swatch‚Äôs color is the color you must apply to any shape on the main board that has that many holes.
- The orange shapes on the main board are 4-connected components. Their interior black pockets (4-connected black regions fully enclosed by the shape and not connected to the outside background) are the ‚Äúholes.‚Äù
- Holes stay black. The blue divider and the palette remain unchanged.

What does not matter
- The exact positions/orientations of the palette swatches.
- Shape outlines (beyond their hole count) and their positions do not affect the color choice.

Algorithm
1. Read the palette: for each swatch, count its internal black squares k and record map[k] = swatch color.
2. Find each orange connected component on the main board.
3. Count its number of internal holes (black regions enclosed by the component; use flood-fill from outside to exclude background).
4. If its hole-count h is in map, recolor the entire component to map[h]; otherwise leave it orange.
5. Keep holes black; leave the blue divider and palette untouched.

Check against training
- Example 1 palette: 0‚Üíyellow, 1‚Üígreen, 2‚Üíblue, 3‚Üíred. Output recolors shapes accordingly.
- Example 2 palette: 0‚Üíred, 1‚Üígreen. Only those two hole-counts occur; shapes recolor accordingly.

For the provided test image
- Palette on the right encodes: 2 holes ‚Üí brown, 4 holes ‚Üí magenta, 5 holes ‚Üí yellow.
- Apply the algorithm; any shape with 2/4/5 holes takes those colors; other hole-counts (if any) remain orange.

<summary>Naive reasoning (e3721c99)</summary>

here‚Äôs what this puzzle is doing (based on the two training pairs):

## What the task is

* You‚Äôre given a 30√ó30 grid with background `0`s.
* There are **‚Äúexample tiles‚Äù (a legend)** near the top: tight little bands of non-zero colors laid out over exactly **three rows** (and a few columns).
  In the first pair those examples show `4`, `3`, `1`, `2` in distinct micro-patterns; in the second pair they show mostly `2` and `3` (with some `1`s elsewhere).
* Elsewhere in the grid there‚Äôs a **big, irregular region of `5`s** (lots of blobs/lines).
* The output keeps everything that isn‚Äôt a `5` **unchanged**, and **recolors every `5`** using only the colors/patterns demonstrated by the examples.

## What changes vs. what stays the same

* **Unchanged:** all `0`s; all pre-existing non-zero colors that are **not** `5` (e.g., the row of `1`s in training #1, the vertical `1`s and the top example bands in training #2).
* **Changed:** every `5` becomes one of the example colors. No new colors are invented‚Äîonly colors that appear in the legend are used.

## How the recoloring seems to work

The legend doesn‚Äôt just list colors; it shows **micro-stencils**‚Äîtiny three-row motifs. Those motifs get **reapplied inside the `5` region according to local shape/thickness**, so you see the same three-row patterns replicated down in the big area:

* A **solid, chunky 3√ó3 block** of `5`s (dense interior) becomes the **‚Äúsolid‚Äù example color** (in training #1 that‚Äôs `4`).
* A **3√ó3 ‚Äúdonut‚Äù/ring** configuration (edge/thin perimeter) becomes the **‚Äúdonut‚Äù example color** (in training #1 that‚Äôs `3`).
* **Longer, 3√ó5 ring-like spans** map to the 3√ó5 legend color (in training #1 that‚Äôs `1`).
* **Even wider, 3√ó7 alternating/striped spans** map to the 3√ó7 legend color (in training #1 that‚Äôs `2`).

So, informally: the algorithm scans the `5` area with a local window (effectively three rows tall), recognizes which **example stencil** best matches the local thickness/period of the `5`s, and **relabels those `5` cells** with the corresponding legend color. This is why in the outputs you can literally see repeating triplets like `x x x / x 0 x / x x x` (the donut) or solid 3√ó3 blocks, or the wider 3√ó5 / 3√ó7 bands, all in the example colors.

## Evidence from the training pairs

* Only `5`s change; other colors pass through untouched.
* The output never uses a color that didn‚Äôt appear in the examples.
* The bottom region shows **repeated copies of the legend‚Äôs three-row motifs**, lined up wherever the `5`s form matching local shapes (solid interior vs. ring edge vs. longer bands).
* In training #2, because the top examples are essentially `2` and `3`, the sea of `5`s gets recolored **only** into `2`s and `3`s (with `1`s elsewhere unchanged).

## What to notice in the test input

* The right side contains **new example tiles** arranged in the same three-row ‚Äúdonut‚Äù style but with **different colors**: `8` near the top (rows 2‚Äì4), `6` mid-grid (rows 8‚Äì10), and `4` lower (rows 18‚Äì20).
* There‚Äôs again a large area of `5`s spread across the grid, plus a fixed column of `1`s.
* Following the learned rule, the `5`s will be **repainted** using **only** the example colors shown in this grid (not inventing any others), and in **three-row motifs** that match the local structure (dense interior vs. donut/edge vs. longer spans), while everything else remains as is.

### Project

_This project desperately needs code cleanup and improved logging._

I have other branches (listed below) that address some of the really low hanging fruit: label images more clearly, provide more tools, clean up prompts, allow second attempt. But for some baffling reason it performs much worse (even on specific problems), so I rolled back to this messier approach.

**Branches:**
* `dsl`: Use DSL to allow model to represent puzzle in a structured and efficient way. Does not work well, but very clean implementation and some cool tools/ideas that should be pulled into the main branch.
* `claude-tool`: testing claude with heavy tool use. Results: totally unable to solve almost any problems, even when given specific instructions on how to find solution
* `more-tool-use-checkpoint-aug13`, `tool-use`: investigations for heavier tool use and better prompt iterating (fewer prompts with more thinking, more specific instructions, more tools, etc.)
* `naive-prompting`: baseline for gpt5 without visualization or tools.

### Thoughts and observations 

Future investigation:
* Solving multiple tests if they exist 
* Two attempts to solve
* Improved prompting (specific instructions, more structured flow)
* Natural language DSL generation (ask model to output functions like "find key", "paint boxes X color", etc.)

Interesting takeaways:
* More tools are not beneficial (visualization tool was beneficial but any other tools were not, likely overwhelmed the model) 
* Specific prompting phases help (most successful when gradually introducing new training sets with new prompts) 

Long form thoughts:
